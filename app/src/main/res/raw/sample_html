    <p>There's no denying that <a href=\"http://hypetrak.com/tag/danny-seth/\">Danny Seth</a> made a serious impact on this side of the Atlantic as one of the hottest musical exports from the United Kingdom this year. Gearing up for the upcoming release of his highly-anticipated album, <em>Perception</em>, the London native teased the world with singles like <a href=\"http://hypetrak.com/2015/04/danny-seth-i-arise-because/\">\"I Arise Because,\"</a> <a href=\"http://hypetrak.com/2015/05/premiere-danny-seth-featuring-jimmy-johnson-never-forget/\">\"Never Forget,\"</a> or <a href=\"http://hypetrak.com/2015/06/danny-seth-safe-produced-by-zach-nahome/\">\"Safe\"</a>. Today, we're getting a little bit closer to Perception as Danny has teamed up with Los Angeles-based agency <a href=\"http://theneueschool.com/\">The Neue School</a> to offer a visual teaser for his new long-player. Co-directed by The Neue School and Danny himself, the clip was shot by James Defina &amp; Mike Marasco and supplemented with a score by Zach Nahome.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>THE NEUE SCHOOL</strong></p>
<p>Our idea behind the visual was to give people a glimpse into Danny's concept of perception while spotlighting his journey shaped by British roots.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>DANNY SETH</strong></p>
<p>I teamed up with The Neue School because I was a fan of their work and together we brought to life the struggle and story I tell throughout perception.<br>
The narrative is a poem which includes title tracks from the album and also expresses that perception is just state of mind, and can be altered. <em>Perception</em> will be released September 18 and my next visual will be out very soon. The British are nearly here...</p></blockquote>
